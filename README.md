   ## Installation 

   This is a web based application, to access it please use the link for the deployed project to be found under [Links](#links).

  

   ## UserStory

   As a user i want to a basic random password generator that will at the click of a button produce a 15 character password made up of numbers, special symbols and lower-case and upper-case letters

   ## Development

   The project was developed by doing research into how to create a basic password generator to understand how the java script can  perform this function. I then decided i wished to code my own user interface and so created one from scratch that would be responsive to multiple sized displays.

   ## Usage

   The user goes to the link for the deployed project using the appropriate link in the [Links Section](#links). 
   They then click on the generate password button and the javaScript function will randomly pick 15 characters and display them in the readonly input box. The user can then click the copy button allowing them to copy the password to their clipboard for use later.

   ## Screenshots
